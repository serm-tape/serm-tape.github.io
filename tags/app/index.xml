Everyone will ask each other &amp;ldquo;Where will we have lunch today?&amp;rdquo;, and most of us would say &amp;ldquo;anywhere&amp;rdquo;. We waste time here up to minutes a day. We have tried 3 approaches.
Line vote In Line application, there is a feature to create poll and let everyone in group vote the result. Sound great. But the pain is we have to create new poll + choices everyday we can&amp;rsquo;t reuse it and most of us also have no idea where should we have lunch.</description></item></channel></rss>
