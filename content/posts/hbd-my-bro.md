# Happy birthday website for my bro
Today (ุ6 May) is my older brother’s birthday. I have no present for him so I have an idea that it’s better to make something geek. When I was in grade 11, I have tried this once, at that time I tried to clone WC3 Dota map that has him as a hero but it failed. Now, I have more skill and experience, then I decided to make an easy static web. It looks very cool for someone not in tech industry lol.

The final project looks better than expected. It has 2 html files, one for enter number code if it correct it will go to HBD page. All script and style are packed in those html because I have no time. Finished after 3 hours passed, then I deployed on Netlify. It was super easy.

This project I found several good stuff.

[1happybirtday](http://www.1happybirthday.com) This one have a set of custom happy birthday song for each name. It’s free and also have song for my brother name. It was very lucky that he has common name hahaha.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) This one will deploy your static site after you push your commit to github. Just login and choose your repo. Woo!

And this is the final website looks [like](http://explorer-missions-37171.netlify.com/) (pass code is ‘6530’). Source code available [here](https://github.com/serm-tape/hbd).
